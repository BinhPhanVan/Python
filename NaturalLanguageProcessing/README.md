## Introduce TF-IDF

    TF-IDF (Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency) is a technique used in text data mining. This weight is used to rate the importance of a word in a text. A high value represents a high importance, and it depends on the number of times the word occurs in the text, but offsets by the frequency of that word in the data set. Several variants of tf-idf are commonly used in search systems as a primary tool for evaluating and sorting text based on user queries. Tf-idf is also used to filter stopwords in problems such as text summarization and text classification.
